# Solar Power Prediction Project

This project predicts solar power output (DC_POWER) using weather and generation data from the **Ani Kannal Solar Power Generation Dataset**. The goal is to forecast solar power output based on weather conditions, which can help with energy management and efficiency.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets

This project uses two datasets from Kaggle:

1. **Plant 1 Generation Data**
   - Link: [Ani Kannal - Plant 1 Generation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)
   - Contains DC_POWER, AC_POWER, IRRADIATION, AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE, MODULE_TEMPERATURE, and DATE_TIME.

2. **Plant 1 Weather Sensor Data**
   - Link: [Ani Kannal - Plant 1 Weather Sensor Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data)
   - Contains weather-related features such as temperature, irradiation, and humidity.

> **Note:** Kaggle datasets cannot be redistributed. Please download them manually from Kaggle and save them in the same folder as the notebook.
